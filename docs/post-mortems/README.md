# Post-Mortem Analyses

**Purpose**: Document lessons learned from project failures and successes.

**Files**:
- `01_COMPLETE_PROJECT_UNDERSTANDING.md` - Original project analysis (40+ pages)
- `02_POST_MORTEM_ANALYSIS.md` - Forensic analysis of mistakes (35+ pages)
- `03_THE_WAY_FORWARD.md` - Rebuild guide with best practices (100+ pages)

**Lessons Learned**:
- 26-38 hours wasted due to lack of process
- 220K-320K tokens wasted on out-of-sequence work
- 24-48% efficiency (50-75% waste)
- Constitution violations (started auth before content complete)
- Context loss (30-60 min per session)
- Repository bloat (7.5MB build artifacts)
