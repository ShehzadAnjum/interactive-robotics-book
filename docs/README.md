# Project Documentation

**Purpose**: Documentation for developers (not book content).

**Structure**:
- `architecture/` - System design docs (overview, frontend, backend, database, API)
- `development/` - Developer guides (setup, workflow, testing, debugging)
- `deployment/` - Deployment guides (GitHub Pages, Vercel, database, secrets)
- `agents/` - Agent usage guides (using agents, creating agents)
- `post-mortems/` - Project analyses (lessons learned)

**Principles**:
- Living documentation (update with code changes)
- Onboarding-friendly (new contributor productive in <1 hour)
- Deployment repeatable (no "tribal knowledge")
